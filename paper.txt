# Transfer Learning for Clinical Emotion Recognition in Urdu: A Conformer-Based Approach for Mental Health Assessment

## 1. Abstract
We present a novel approach for clinical emotion recognition in Urdu using a Conformer-based architecture with transfer learning. Our system addresses the challenges of low-resource language processing in healthcare settings by combining audio feature extraction with specialized clinical adapters. The model achieves significant improvements over baseline methods, demonstrating effective emotion classification across four primary emotional states (Angry, Happy, Neutral, Sad). Our approach reduces the data requirements for developing clinical NLP systems in Urdu while maintaining high accuracy, making it practical for real-world mental health applications.

## 2. Introduction
The accurate recognition of emotions in clinical settings is fundamental to mental health assessment and treatment. While Natural Language Processing (NLP) has made significant strides in emotion recognition for high-resource languages, low-resource languages like Urdu face substantial challenges in developing such systems. With over 170 million speakers worldwide, Urdu represents a significant linguistic community with limited NLP resources, particularly in healthcare applications.

### 2.1 Research Objectives
Our work aims to:
1. Develop a Conformer-based transfer learning approach for clinical emotion recognition in Urdu
2. Create an efficient adaptation methodology for clinical domains
3. Demonstrate effective emotion classification with limited training data
4. Provide a practical framework for deployment in healthcare settings

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Architecture Overview
Our system implements a novel Conformer-based architecture specifically designed for clinical emotion recognition in Urdu speech. The architecture integrates four primary components: (1) audio feature extraction with adaptive preprocessing, (2) a Conformer-based encoder for temporal feature modeling, (3) specialized clinical domain adaptation layers, and (4) an emotion classification module. Figure 1 illustrates the complete architecture.

### 3.2 Audio Feature Processing

#### 3.2.1 Input Representation
The system processes raw audio through a sophisticated feature extraction pipeline:
- Mel-spectrogram generation with 80 mel bins
- Input tensor shape: [batch_size, channels, mel_bins, time]
- Preprocessing stages:
  * Waveform normalization to [-1, 1] range
  * Short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
  * Mel-scale filterbank application
  * Log-scale amplitude transformation
  * Feature standardization (μ=0, σ=1)

#### 3.2.2 Waveform Adaptation Layer
The WaveformAdapter module enhances robustness through stochastic feature masking:
- Time-domain masking with probability 0.1
- Learnable mask embeddings
- Linear projection for dimension matching
- Training-time augmentation
